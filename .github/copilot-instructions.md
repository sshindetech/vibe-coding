# Project Instructions

- This is a fullstack project with Expo React Native frontend (using NativeWind/Tailwind and react-native-chart-kit) and a Nest.js backend (using LangChain with Google Gemini and xlsx for Excel parsing).
- The frontend is a single screen for Excel upload, query input, summary, and chart display.
- The backend exposes endpoints for file upload and query, processes Excel files, and uses LangChain with Gemini for financial data analysis.
